Six months ago it was like, ‘What do you have that says, generative AI on it?’ Now we're at, ‘How are you applying that to your core proposition?’ I think as we go into next year, I think we're going to see more real value there and more demonstrable value there. I think we're seeing signs of it right now.”Read more: Looking at how hospitals will be using AI in 2025Ronald Rodriguez, MD, PhD, professor of medical education at UT Health San Antonio“Artificial intelligence has the possibility to transform diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. AI will help clinicians make quicker, more precise decisions, enable more direct interactions with patients, enhance communication and provide personalized care.”Nate Perry-Thistle, chief product & technology officer of CipherHealth“Despite AI’s potential, healthcare organizations remain cautious about its widespread deployment, especially for patient-facing roles. In 2025, we anticipate a ‘measured adoption,’ aimed at demystifying AI, that will focus on supporting healthcare operations without compromising care quality. This means AI will be embraced incrementally—first to assist in data processing, workflow automation, and patient outreach—laying the groundwork for eventual clinical applications. This gradual, strategic approach helps systems build trust and confidence in AI’s role as a supportive force in healthcare.”Shaan Khurshid, MD, cardiologist, Massachusetts General Hospital"I think in 2025 we will see implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) language models (i.e., chatbots) for some aspects of routine clinical care, such as the preparation of patient communications, generation of preliminary diagnostic test reports, or summarization of patient medical records."Jonathan Shoemaker, CEO of ABOUT Healthcare“In recent years, the increased demand for care has placed unprecedented strain on provider resources, highlighting the inefficiencies of the transactional care delivery model. In 2025, AI-driven patient throughput will empower providers to deliver more accessible, efficient, and personalized care. These technologies will streamline workflows, integrate data, and guide patients to the optimal care setting, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing clinical decision-making. By improving engagement and outcomes, technology can support providers in aligning with value-based care goals and adapting to the evolving needs of patients in a rapidly transforming healthcare landscape.”Kim Perry, chief growth officer, emtelligent,“In the coming year, health systems will increasingly be called upon to scale quality and operational improvements across their networks, while simultaneously battling a very real clinician burnout crisis. By automating complex billing, coding, and documentation tasks, medically aligned AI will help protect revenue, reduce administrative load, and free clinicians to focus on patient care. Beyond financial impact, AI will close workflow gaps, streamline care transitions, and reduce readmissions, making it indispensable for improving system-wide quality, efficiency, and revenue.”Stephanie Lahr, MD, president of Artisight“Healthcare's next frontier will be shaped by computer vision technologies that enhance, rather than replace, clinical decision-making. Just as we've seen in other industries, capabilities evolve gradually and healthcare will experience a measured progression in AI adoption, with each advancement carefully balanced against ethical considerations and governance frameworks. The key will be ensuring these systems adapt to local healthcare environments while maintaining transparency and trust.”Anurag Mehta, CEO & co-founder, Omega Healthcare“In 2025, the healthcare industry will start to witness a dramatic shift in revenue cycle management as healthcare providers move beyond viewing AI as just a cost-cutting tool to embracing it as a strategic imperative for improving patient care and financial outcomes. The emerging concept of 'responsible RCM' will gain traction, where providers leverage AI not just to maximize revenues but to also create more transparent, patient-friendly financial experiences while ensuring accuracy and compliance.”Chris Hartemayer, EVP of enterprise operations at R1“In 2025, providers will rely heavily on AI to meet the dual challenges of operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. From guiding patients to the right care setting to automating revenue cycle processes, AI will create a more streamlined and responsive healthcare ecosystem. By integrating these technologies into daily operations, providers will enhance care delivery, reduce burnout, and build sustainable practices capable of thriving in a rapidly changing industry.”Sandra Johnson, SVP of client services at CliniComp“In 2025, the adoption of AI in healthcare will advance significantly, bringing more sophisticated applications in predictive analytics, personalized medicine, and clinical decision support. This evolution will drive substantial improvements in patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and clinician satisfaction. By focusing on workflow automation and reducing the time spent in EHR systems, we can reintroduce joy into healthcare, allowing providers to dedicate more time to patient care and fostering a more fulfilling work environment.”Tom Langan, Interim CEO of Veradigm“It is becoming more financially and administratively difficult to run a healthcare provider practice. Staff shortages and increasing regulatory complexities are contributing to an ever-growing administrative burden felt by practices across the United States. As we head into 2025, I predict that practices that embrace resource-saving solutions like AI-enabled ambient scribing, mobile patient engagement platforms, and tech-enabled revenue cycle services, will be better suited to face the business and financial challenges presented to them.”Michael Young, co-founder of Lindus Health“The increased use of AI and wearable technologies will only expand the capabilities of decentralized trials. Companies are developing AI-powered diagnostics that analyze biomarkers that more accurately reflect disease state that can be used for assessing trial participants’ data. AI can also detect anomalies in health data provided by smartwatches and other wearable devices, flagging concerning data to medical monitors to enable faster decision-making and responsiveness to safety issues.”Dr. Mimi Winsberg, co-founder and chief medical officer at Brightside Health“AI will be widely adopted as a time-saving assistant for clinicians. Most clinicians welcome AI tools and assistants to help with automated tasks and case note generation, and user satisfaction thus far has been high. These tools can help them spend their time with patients, rather than in repetitive administrative tasks. In addition, AI will improve diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment response. AI will also drive care insights directly to patients. As models become more refined, there will be greater trust in technology that actively supports both patients and clinicians, making mental health care more proactive and personalized.”Eric Rock, CEO and founder of Percipio Health"In the coming year, we are going to see the value of AI begin to prove out in a few specific use cases, such as population health monitoring, giving many providers and payers the confidence they have been waiting for to adopt AI technology. For example, many provider and payer organizations will begin using AI-powered applications to collect a broad range of health signals, such as device-free biometrics, brain health assessments and medication scanning. These will be used for earlier prediction of disease risks and avoidance of acute care utilization at much broader scale, leading to improved value-based measures that we have all been seeking."Kengo Takishima, president and CEO, Baylor Genetics“In 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to become an even more pivotal force in genetic testing and precision medicine, driving advancements that can reshape patient care. As the industry continues to generate immense volumes of genomic data at both individual and population levels, the focus will increasingly shift to leveraging AI to transform this data into actionable clinical insights. This will be particularly critical for identifying pathogenic variants and mutations that influence medical diagnoses, treatment planning, and policy development.”Recent VideosRelated Content Yes, most health leaders will focus more on health equity in 2025Ron SouthwickJanuary 29th 2025ArticleExecutives are going to do work on closing disparities in disadvantaged groups, a Deloitte report finds.
