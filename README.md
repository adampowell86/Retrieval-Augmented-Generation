# RAG System for Machine Learning Document

## Overview
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer user queries using content from a Wikipedia page on *Machine Learning*. The system extracts and processes the document, generates semantic embeddings, retrieves the most relevant sections using cosine similarity, and produces answers using the Flan-T5 text generation model.

## Document Overview
The document used in this project is the Wikipedia page on *Machine Learning*. It provides definitions, types, and applications of machine learning. The content was scraped, cleaned of extraneous elements (e.g., HTML tags, scripts), and stored in `Selected_Document.txt`.

## How the Program Works
1. **Document Processing**  
   The text from `Selected_Document.txt` is read and split into manageable chunks.
   
2. **Embedding Generation**  
   The SentenceTransformers model converts each text chunk into embeddings (numerical vectors) that capture semantic meaning.
   
3. **Retrieval Using Cosine Similarity**  
   When a query is entered, the system generates an embedding for the query and computes cosine similarity with the stored embeddings. The top three most relevant text chunks are retrieved.
   
4. **Answer Generation with Flan-T5**  
   The retrieved chunks are combined with the user query to form a prompt, which is then processed by the Flan-T5 model to generate an answer.

## Five Key Questions & Answers
1. **What is cosine similarity?**  
   Cosine similarity is a metric that measures the similarity between two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. It is used here to determine which text chunks best match the user's query.
   
2. **Why use SentenceTransformers?**  
   SentenceTransformers efficiently converts text into embeddings that capture semantic meaning, enabling effective matching of queries with relevant text.
   
3. **What are embeddings?**  
   Embeddings are numerical representations of text that allow for mathematical comparison, making it possible to determine the similarity between different pieces of content.
   
4. **Why chunk the document?**  
   Splitting the document into chunks helps manage model input size limitations and improves the relevance of retrieved information by focusing on smaller, context-specific sections.
   
5. **How does Flan-T5 work?**  
   Flan-T5 is a text-to-text generation model that generates answers based on a prompt containing both the retrieved context and the user query.

## System Analysis

### Performance
- **Retrieval:**  
  The system retrieves text chunks using cosine similarity, successfully matching key phrases from the query. In some cases, however, the retrieved chunks may lack broader context.
  
- **Response Generation:**  
  Responses are generally accurate and contextually relevant, though some answers may occasionally be vague or lack detail.

### Improvements
1. **Larger Embedding Models:**  
   Experiment with models such as `all-mpnet-base-v2` to potentially enhance semantic representation.
   
2. **Hybrid Retrieval Methods:**  
   Combine embedding-based retrieval with traditional methods like BM25 to improve relevance.
   
3. **Fine-tuning the Generation Model:**  
   Fine-tune the Flan-T5 model on domain-specific data to improve the specificity and depth of generated answers.

## Example Queries & Outputs

**Query 1:** "What is supervised learning?"  
- **Retrieved Chunks:**  
  - "Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data..."
  - "Common applications include classification and regression."  
- **Response:**  
  "Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train models for prediction tasks like classification."

**Query 2:** "Explain overfitting."  
- **Retrieved Chunks:**  
  - "Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise and details from the training data..."
  - "This leads to poor performance on new, unseen data."  
- **Response:**  
  "Overfitting happens when a model captures noise from the training data, resulting in reduced performance on unseen data."

**Query 3:** "What are the main applications of machine learning?"  
- **Retrieved Chunks:**  
  - "Machine learning is widely used in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems..."
  - "It plays a key role in predictive analytics and data-driven decision making."  
- **Response:**  
  "Machine learning is applied in various domains including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics to drive data-informed decisions."

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the RAG System
Execute the main script:
```bash
python rag_system.py
```
The program will prompt you to enter your queries interactively. Type `"exit"` to quit the program.

## Conclusion
This RAG system demonstrates the integration of retrieval-based methods with modern text generation to answer queries using a curated document. While the current implementation is effective, further enhancements—such as using more advanced models or hybrid retrieval strategies—could improve the depth and accuracy of responses.
